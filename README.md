Machine learning has been helpful in the healthcare industry in many ways such as disease diagnosis, medical imaging, medical robots, etc. In this final project that I have been working on, I will detect the disease diabetic retinopathy using deep neural networks. Diabetic retinopathy is a disease that occurs as a result of complications in diabetic patients and affects the patients’ eyesight. Using machine learning, doctors will be able to detect blindness before it occurs and save the lives of millions of people worldwide. This is extremely powerful. This disease is seen in patients whose blood sugar levels are left uncontrolled for long periods of time. The blood vessels in the patients’ retina rupture and causes for partial or complete blindness.
